This was another project to learn how to handle error properly in rust using loops and match statements.

This is a simple program that collects user input from the cli and uses error handling to sift through a bunch of predetermined instructions that the code must follow and respect. 

**TO START**
1. Install the rust sdk and cargo from rustlang.org on windows/mac/linux os
2. run the command "git clone https://github.com/totdking/book_genre-rating.git" on your command line interface
3. run cargo run -q while in the "book_genre-rating" folder to start the program
4. Kindly follow the instructions that appear on screen after the program is started. 

ENJOY :)
